To run mpi_trap_rule.c

We fist want to make sure to source and load mpicc (check out howtorunhelloworld in the same directory)
We first want to compile it by doing mpicc -g -Wall -o mpi_trap_rule trap_rule.c
then we want to execute it by doing mpiexec -n 4 ./mpi_trap_rule
We will then get our answer if we decide to make any changes to the file we can just recompile it by doing...
mpicc -g -Wall -o mpi_trap_rule trap_rule.c again

One thing to note is that since my cpu on my laptop ryzen 5000 series 7  only has 8 cores and 16 threads
thus if i can only run a max of 8 processes but if i want to run up to 16 i have to use the command..
mpiexec -np 16 --use-hwthread-cpus ./mpi_trap_rule
