To run mpi this is what i did:

1) i had an issue on my system where I was being put into a conda environemnt from the jump, I think I fixed into
 - if i ever see base in my terminal at the beginning of the line it means i am most likely in conda env.
 - i changed it so that it would be made to be false and also hopefully so it doesnt auto put me into a conda env
 2) I downloaded mpicc on my system 
  - i ran the following commands:
  sudo dnf install openmpi openmpi-devel //to download openmpi
  source /etc/profile.d/modules.sh  // to set env variable using fedoras module environemnt program; source it 
  module load mpi/openmpi-x86_64  //load it 

  // it may be the case that everytime i open up new terminal i may need to source and load mpi to use it
  // if i want to avoid having to do that i can ...
  // Do note that youâ€™ll have to source and load the OpenMPI module for every shell you open unless you add it within $HOME/.bashrc.
