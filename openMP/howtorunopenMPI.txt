Create C or C++ program and make sure the program is set up properly to run correctly with openMP 
- Make sure the compiler supports openMP and set up the pragmas if need be

To compile an openMP program do something like this..
gcc -g -Wall -fopenmp -o hello_omp hello_omp.c

- note that -fopenmp is unique to openMP

to execute do this
./hello_omp 4

where hello_omp is the executable and 4 is the number of threads you want to pass into it 

- note that the number of threads you want to pass into it is asked for by the program itself which requires it otherwise we could handle it differntly
