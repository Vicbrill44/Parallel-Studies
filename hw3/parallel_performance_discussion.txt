There are a couple of reasons why we don't see good speedup and efficiency. For one the overhead of managing threads could be costing us on performance. Another reason could be that only portions of the code is being parallized which could also lead to slower performance than we would like. False sharing is also another problem that could be occuring on the lower level. We could also note that maybe we would see the real performance advantage if we used larger images. To increase performance I could find a better way to schedule the loops to find better performance.
