This is a quick rundown as to how to run cuda:

1) To run cuda you must have an NVIDIA GPU
2) If you do you must download the NVIDIA toolkit to run cuda
  - This will give you the tools (nvcc) to run CUDA programs
  - You also need to set an environemnt varaible for nvcc
  - it is a whole process to setup NVIDIA toolkit
  - https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html
3) You will need to add the extension .cu to indicate CUDA programs
  - even though you can write code in C and C++
4) To compile:
  nvcc -o hello_cuda hello_cuda.cuda
5) To execute:
  ./hello_cuda [thread_blocks][threads_per_block]

  The things in [] are optional but these are typically wanted by the prg
